What is this stuff ? 
This folder contains these source code files that can be executed on Zolertia Z1 motes:

1. snd_broadcast_UDP.c
2. rcv_UDP.c
3. unicast_snd.c
4. ipv6_addr_lib.c

The purpose of each source code is explained in the source code files themselves.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How to compile ?

make TARGET=z1 'xxx' 

where 'xxx' is the name of source code without the inverse comma and .c extention

Example: 
make TARGET=z1 snd_broadcast_UDP

Antoher solution is to compile through Cooja simulation enviroinment.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How can I see the output ?
To see the output is needed either the Zolertia Z1 motes connected to USB interface or the Cooja simulation enviroinment by which is possible to deploy a sensor network.
The simulation file is already present in this folder.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It doesn't work. Why ?
The compilation process and execution has been made on Contiki Operating System that contains already all library for Zolertia Z1 motes. Maybe you are using either a different Operating System or you don't have the needed library. Moreover, if you'are using the Cooja enviroiment, try to reload and re-start the simulation.
